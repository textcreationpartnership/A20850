            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> a haynous matter for any man to meddle with the ſame, which in deede is not a Phiſition. For Chirurgery is maymed, and vtterlie vnperfect, without the healpe of thoſe other partes, which conſiſteth in preſcribing of inward medicines, and conuenient diet.</p>
            <p>And is ſo neare linked with theſe in a lyance, that no man deſerueth to be called a Chirurgion, that is ignorant in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke.</p>
            <p>For vlcers, Apoſtumes, or any other extreme affects of the ſkinne, haue their originall from ſome inward cauſe, and nature expelleth them from thence vnto the ſkinne, as vnto a naturall clenſing place. Likewiſe in wounds that are inward, there happeneth oftentimes ebullicion of humours by meanes of anger, or ſome other paſſion of the minde, wherevnto if due regard be not giuen, the Chirurgians la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is in vaine, and his topicall medicines applyed to no purpoſe.
<pb facs="tcp:306:3"/> If this ſeeme obſcure or falſe vnto any man, let him reade Hippocrates touching the ſtuffe which a phiſition is to vſe. For in that place he ſetteth downe moſt euidentlie, what emplaiſters, Vnguents, and other inſtruments, are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the Phiſition. Let him alſo conſider that he ſheweth that the very rootes of vlcers &amp; apoſtumes, ought firſt to bee plucked vp. Let him alſo weigh how he teacheth, that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall regard is to be had, to the appointing of conuenient dyet. And ſo ſhall he well vnderſtand that Chirurgians ought to be ſeene in phiſicke, and that the Barbours crafte ought not to be tearmed chirurgerie.</p>
            <p>But why am I ſo tedious heerein? when as the verie difinition of phiſicke, doth agree with chirurgirie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if chirurgerie be phiſicke, no wiſe man will denie but that the chirurgians ought to be ſeene in phiſicke, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering they worke both vppon one ſubiect. Wherefore they ought not to be tearmed chirurgians which haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nothing but the compoſition of two or three emplai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters out of Barbours ſhoppes, neither yet Barbours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, nor vnſkilfull women, beſides a number of blinde buſſardly bayardes, which maiſter Wiliam Clowes hath moſt properlie painted foorth in their right coulours, in his booke entituled de Morbo Gallico, wherefore I omit them, although they confidently cracke and bragge that they can cure any thing.</p>
            <p>And with great boldneſſe doe take vppon them the practiſe of this ſcience, inſomuch that they deptiue men of learning of their due commodities heerein. Giueing out that ſuch are phiſitions and not chirurgians. As though the chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgian ought not to be ſeene in phiſicke, or that he could be a phiſition, that were ignorant in chirurgerie.</p>
            <p>But oh good God, is it tollerable that the auncient glorie and renoume of chirurgirie ſhould be ſo defaced or that ſuch men as haue ſpent all their time in it, ſhould ſo iniuriouſly be put from the benefit of the ſame.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:306:3"/>
            <p>If therefore theſe men that haue all their time beſtowed their ſtudies in chirurgerie for the reliefe of ſuch as are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed: doubtles they may freely (notwithſtanding the gaineſaying of carping crackers and blinde empericks) vndertake the practiſe of this part of phiſick in any place. Conſidering the beginning of theſe ordinary chirurgians, which commonlie we call barbara chirurgians, reade Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalius in his epiſtle which he ſet foorth before his worke of the frame of mans body.</p>
            <p>In which place he ſetteth downe the reaſon whie in theſe our daies, chirurgerie is deuided from phiſick, not without great hurt vnto mankinde. I write not theſe things vnto you (louing friends) for that I would in anie wiſe aboliſh the auncient priuiledge which hath beene graunted in times paſt vnto the Barbors of the Cittie of London, for there are in the ſaide Cittie (which alſo vſe Barberie) that are verie expert and ſkilfull in chirurgerie.</p>
            <p>But for my part let them practiſe this arte ſuch as will, and are diſpoſed to keepe them from hunger and colde.</p>
            <p>Onely this I note, the abuſes heerein of our preſent time, yeelding altogether the practiſe of this noble arte, (to the great hinderance of the common weale) vnto men vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and I doe withall affirme that all chirurgians ought to be ſeene in phiſicke: and that the Barbors crafte ought to be a diſtinct miſtery from chirurgery. I thought it good (louing friendes) to diſcourſe vnto you ſomething at large in this matter, that ye might underſtand how farre this arte in theſe our daies is fallen from the auncient and true chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and how much the beautie of the ſame is blemiſhed and defaced, by theſe obſcure and baſe emperickes. Neither is it without cauſe (louing patron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) that I haue ſpent all this time with you in theſe matters.</p>
            <p>For you are they, which in moſt delighted in chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, you are they, by whom chirurgerie being decayed may hope for reformacion, you are they which for your ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb facs="tcp:306:4"/> ſkill heerein, are able to iudge of all ſuch imperfections as lurke among theſe buſardlie empericks. You are they that are able to defend the true &amp; ſincere chirurgerie, againſt the falſe and corrupt. In conſideration whereof I thought it not amiſſe heerein to publiſh vnto you (my courteous friends) theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uctors which I haue tranſlated, hoping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that the ruder ſorte being alured with the facilitie and eaſineſſe of the ſame, will more earneſtly apply their mindes to the learning thereof. And that many will bee moued hereby the ſooner, whome otherwiſe conceit of difficultie might haue feared away.</p>
            <p>But I am aſſured that I ſhall hereby incurre the hatred of the enuious, and the reprehencions of carping quarrellers. But that ſome profite may come by this my paynes, vnto ſuch as are ſtudious in Chirurgerie, I eſteeme nothing of them, for I know I ſhall be eaſilie able to put to ſilence thoſe vnnaturall perſons.</p>
            <p>It may be that ſome will thinke me of Antiſthenes faction, that laide platformes of euery mans life, and yet the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher was more wiſe in his precepts, then wary of his owne gouernment and ſay, I haue reached aboue my ſkill, in limiting other mens doeings. But if I haue intermedled to farre, it is (curteous friends) not in cenſuring the actions of the good and vertuous, but in diſcouering the abuſes of the lewde. For I reprehend not as one thinking generally all bad, hut perſwade, as one wiſhing perticularlie euerie one ſhould liue well, and dye better.</p>
            <p>And therefore (my curteous friends) I am moſt earneſtly to craue your asſiſtance (in protecting this rude worke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt fruits of my trauaills.

            <p>And being as it were heretofore dead, recouer her life and decayed eſtate, and that by your good aſsiſtance, learned profeſſours may be appointed in all conuenient places, to publiſh and ſet foorth the ſame. For ſo will it come to paſſe, that in ſhort time this famous Arte will bee reſtored to her auncient perfection, vnto the great commoditie of the common weale.</p>
            <p>If anie that are enuious grudge at my doings, I ſtraight for refuge flie to your good Cencure, which I count as a ſufficient defenſorie againſt ſuch as loue to backebite.

And as the deafe cannot diſcerne the ſweetneſſe of Muſicke: ſo the ignorant cannot looke into the excellencie of knowledge. For there is in theſe daies many that are ſo wilfull in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that being reproued for their ignoraunce, ſticke not to threaten with woords, ſwordes, Curtelaſes, and Daggers, to wounde, cut, ſlaſh, yea and kill ſuch good men who are painefull ſtudients and labourers in the Arte.</p>
            <p>As I red of that good man Maiſter Iohn Hall of Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, who although he were a ſkillful man, and of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vertues in the Arte of Chirurgerie, yet for ſpeaking againſt the deceiptfull ſorcery of one Robart Harris, in An. Dom. 1556. He had a dagger drawen at him, as himſelfe doth declare in his expoſtulations.
<pb facs="tcp:306:5"/> And alſo it is credibly reported, that in Anno domini 1574. One Maſter Bactor a man of good knowledge, both in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke and Chirurgery, for the reprouing of the great abuſes of one Fower Akers, he had a ſword drawen at him as hee trauailed on the waie, and likelie to haue beene ſpoyled, had not other trauailers aſiſted him. I may well veryfie the ſayings of good Maſter Banniſter, who doth explaine their diueliſh practiſes, hauing neither learning, knowledge, modeſtie, nor honiſtie. And yet practiſe abroad their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed deceipts vnder the colour of admittance from the Hall of London, and ſome from others being in aucthory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of which ſort I could name a great number, which for modeſties ſake, I omit. A thing greatly to be lamented that thoſe which are or ſhould be the fathers of arte, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of good artiſts, ſhould ſo ſlightly paſſe their licenſe to ſuch ignoraunt aſſes, to maintaine them, not onely in cooſining her Maieſties ſubiects of their monie, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times depriue them of their lims, yea and alſo their liues. But it is no meruaile, for monie is ſweete, and what is it but Lucre may doe? for I my ſelfe talking with one of the ſame companie and felowſhip, complayning vppon the abuſes thereof, in paſſing their licenſes to ſuch, made me this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. In deed quoth he it is not well, but we were as good to take their monie, for they would play the knaues neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe. Surely his aunſwere was truer then he wiſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a matter moſt lamentable. For whereas by the good and godly lawes of the realme, they are prohibited from practiſing or medling in the arte without licenſe, (before the which ſhould goe and approbation as well as examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) now for ſooth for monie they may buy them a cloake to coeuer them from the lawe, and to play their partes at will. Yet among the reſt, I know ſome one of ſmall lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and leſſe knowledge, who hauing trauailed 180. miels to fetch a ſeale weying fower pound beſides the a purtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therevnto belonging, whereby he is growen ſo farre in

And being an other time demaunded by a learned Doctor in Phiſicke how a wound came to be an vlcer, was ſtricken dum. And yet of like he might aunſwere his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations well. For that (as he ſaith) he was vſed ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly, and plaſt amongeſt the beſt. A meane ſurely to embolden him well. For he was but baſhfull when he was before the worſhipfull Doctor. And yet will not ſticke to make himſelfe comparable to any, and will impudentlie cracke, that any man ſhal neuer attaine to do the like cures as he hath don, with a great deale more of ſhameles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. There are others of the kinde of young Cuckooſe, or as nuſeled Snakes, which flie with Iſops Crowe, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pluct the winges, would faine deuoure the bird.</p>
            <p>But leauing them to their blindneſſes, and praying vnto God for their amendment, my purpoſe is heere to do them good that haue neede, that is to diſtribute in engliſh to them that are vnlearned, parte of the treaſure that is in other lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages, to prouoke them that are of better learning, to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their knowledge in ſuch like attemptes: finally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that to the vſe of many, which ought not to be ſecret for lucre of a few, and to communicate the fruite of my labours, to them that will gentlly and thankefullie receiue
<pb facs="tcp:306:6"/> them, which if any be ſo proud or ſupercilious, that they immediatlie will deſpiſe, I ſhall friendlie deſire them, with the wordes of Horace: Quod ſi meliora nouiſti candide im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perti, ſi non his vtere mecum.</p>
            <p>If they know better, let vs haue part: If they doe not, why repine they at thoſe which meane well? why condemne they the thinges that they cannot amend. Or if they can, why diſſemble they their cunning? How long would they haue people ignorant?</p>
            <p>Why grutch they Chirurgerie ſhould come foorth in Engliſh? would they haue no man to know but onely they? or what make they themſelues? for if Galen the Prince of this arte being a Grecian wrote in the Greeke: King Aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene of Arabia in the ſpeech of the Arayans: If Plinius, Celſus, Serenus, &amp; other of the Latines wrote to the people in the Latin tongue: Mercellus Ficinus (who all men aſſent to be ſingulerly learned) diſdained not to write in the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an tongue: generally, if the intent of all that euer ſet foorth any noble ſtudie, haue beene to be read, of as many as woulde: what reaſon is it, that we ſhould huther muther heere among a few, the thing that was made common to all? Chriſt ſayeth: no man lighteth a Candell to couer it with a Buſhell, but ſetteth it to ſerue euery mans turne; and theſe goe about, not onelie to couer it when it is lighted, but to quench it afore it bee kindled (if they might by mallice) which verie well veryfieth the ſayings of Maiſter William CLOWES in his laſt edicion De Morbo Gallico, whoſe wordes are theſe.

            <p>Cur non poſuiſti talentum in fenus? Why haſt thou not beſtowed my talent to the vauntage. Theſe and ſuch other examples haue enforced me being oftentimes exerciſed in the ſtudie and practiſe of Chirurgerie, to follow the good endeuours of other good men, who haue taſted of the ſame cuppe of enuie, as their predeceſſours haue done. And ſhall I perſwade my ſelfe to eſcape the ſame? No, for as I am cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly
<pb facs="tcp:306:7"/> enformed by my verie good friends, that my booke was not ſo ſoone at the preſſe, as enuie euen readie to repine at the ſame.

And nothing bee diſcouraged at them, for I know thoſe that are godly and well diſpoſed, will curteouſly except of euerie good and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable attempt. And for the malitious, ſmall regard is to bee giuen, for I doe perceaue that now in our time, no good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe can be gone about, but falſe detraction and enuie is readie to ouerthrow the ſame. For what are they that haue written both in auncient and later times, but they haue taſted of this beaſtly broode, and enuious ſect? Yea and of ſuch men that haue as it were dandled them in their lappes.</p>
            <p>For I cannot onely ſpeake by experience of my ſelfe, but alſo by certaine knowledge of ſome others, that breding vp vnder our ſelues ſuch impes, who we did not onely giue ſufficient maintenance vnto, but alſo did impart vnto them thoſe things which we by long ſtudie and chargeable labour had found out. But when (as they thought) there was no more to be gotten, and them ſelues ſufficiently furniſhed, being gone from their Maiſters, were preſently puffed vp in pride, and being better perſwaded of them ſelues, then of their carefull teachers, forgetting from whence they ſucked their milke, goe about by all meanes (as much as in them lieth, to the aduauncement of their owne glorie) to ſeeke the ouerthrow of their Maiſters credits.</p>
            <p>But vnhappie are thoſe men which nuſell ſuch whelpes, or hath ſuch fire brands, but ſurely they doe but kindle coles to burne them ſelues, for their rewarde ſhalbe to haue the like ſeruaunts, to ſerue their owne turnes.</p>
            <p>For as our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith: <hi>ſuch bread as we breake, ſhalbe broken to vs againe.</hi>

            <p>And as in reproouing the euill, I wiſh not the good to bee offended, contrariewiſe, in prayſing the good, I wiſh the euill no parte thereof. For if good menne in times paſt haue beeue mooued with good concience, for knowledge ſake, and for the better maintenance of their common wealth in ſetting foorth this Arte (in our vulger tounge) for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, comfort, ſuccour, helpe, and health of ſuch as are ſicke, deſeaſed, or otherwiſe wounded and hurt in the warres, or by ſome miſchaunce, why ſhould they be ſo enuied at, yea euen of thoſe which haue pluckt fetherse from their winges, and hath not been aſhamed to vſe them among their owne. But theſe that haue ſo learned of Dedalus, to frame wings by Arte, which could not be had by nature, let them take heede leaſt by playing with other birds fethers, not ſkilful to vſe the ſame, they receaue the reward of Icarus.</p>
            <p>But as the wiſe man ſaith, it is a ſkabbe of the world, to bee enuious at vertue: for enuie groweth vp among ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>

Whereas a man being moued with honeſt care to profit his countrie, and to leaue ſome teſtimony of the ſame behind him, doe publiſh any worke, it behoueth him to ſhow ſome reaſon for his doinges, or elſe it will not yeelde his hoped for benefit.</p>
            <p>Which is to be conſtrued and peruſed with humanitie, ſo that if a man couet to haue his bookes fauorablie excepted and read, he muſt behaue himſelfe in writing, as Solon did in framing his lawes.</p>
            <p>Who (as Plutarch ſaith) did not faſhion them according to the true line of equitie, but ſet downe ſuch as he thought the people would willinglie obſerue: euen ſo the iniquitie of the time hath brough to paſſe, that thoſe bookes which are generally peruſed and read throughout, muſt not ſerue the time, but ſatiſfie the opinions of men.</p>
            <p>A man may eaſilie diſcourſe of this, but the fantaſies of men are to variant to peruaile a whit in diſwading them.</p>
            <p>But if it might, I would perſwade ſome one from his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>For it is ſecretlie giuen out, and wih no little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe, that CALMETEVS ſhall in haſt bee publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in ENGLISH, but I would the good man who hath taken the pains, had at his conuenient leyſure, firſt haue read Maiſter Banniſters bookes of vlcers, &amp; of tumors
<pb facs="tcp:306:11"/> againſt nature are wounds, and conferred them together with Calmetius, might ſo haue ſaued his laobur, for there ſhall hee ſee the flowers of Calmeteus ſo cleane gathered, that he which comes after ſhalbe faine to brouſe vppon the bare ſhrubbs. Vnleſſe he do it againe for tery-fiyng the good olde Gentleman (who hath alredy taken the paines) and to bring him out of conceite with that he hath done, which I thinke will hardly bee. But for mine owne parte that I may now ende, I haue not ſought or hunted after vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by the publiſhing of this my labour, but onely I haue endured by this meanes being vnable any waye elſe to doe ſome good to my Countrie, which deſire of mine ſhall ſufficientlie comfort me, though I want the outward approbation of the world. And yet this one thing I would craue at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the learned, that if my boks by chaunce come vnder their cenſure, they wil either giue it their good word, or elſe ſuffer themſelues to bee Iudged off by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourming the lyke labour.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F, according to the olde ſaying of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ickes (moſt learned Aria) men are begotten for mens ſakes, then are thoſe to be eſteemed greateſt, and had in higheſt accompt, that which daylie moſt doe profite the common health of man. Which, though by ſundrie ſkills, it may be performed, yet by none more amply then that of curing diſeaſes, the Art whereof, hath made her ſtudentes immortall, or of eternall memorie.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing your Arcaeus is of this number, and one who in following, and exerciſing this arte, hath made himſelfe ſo famous in his countrie, as no man liuing the like: howe much more renowmed (thinke you) ſhall he bee, if thoſe thinges he hath practiſed with his hands amongſt the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, may in writing be teſtified alſo vnto the learned? ſurelie (as one ſaith) he ſhould aduaunce his head among the ſtarres. But this glorie gotten by ſuch induſtrie, diligence, labour, and incredible cunning, ſhall together with the auctor, languiſh &amp; periſh in obliuion, vnleſſe by your meanes it be brought abroad into the light.</p>
            <p>Make common therefore that which the common Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgians know not, and let not ſuch healthfull remedies lye ſecret by you, leaſt your readineſſe in communicating the benefite, ſhould ſeeme leſſe, then was the aucthors willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in beſtowing it. And that I may not ſeeme as of no force to begge it, but euen by good right to demaund it at your hands, thus doe I iudge, that the booke of wounds, is not onely profitable, but alſo neceſſarie. For it not onelye teacheth thoſe thinges, which with many faultes, and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
<pb facs="tcp:306:12"/> errours, are vnlearnedly, and vnſkilfully written off by the barbarous, but alſo ſo reſelleth the ignoraunce of our Chirurgions, <note place="margin">As vvell in Englande as in ſpain.</note> that hee ſeemeth vnto me, to haue deliuered mortall men from their tyrannie, whome Galen rightly compared vnto theeues.</p>
            <p>Moreouer our age ſhall learne ſome thinges, which other antiquitie knowe not, or left as imposſible to be ſet down, namely to cure happelie, and with an eaſie method: yea and that with remedies either gotten by muche practiſe and iudgement, or elſe fetched from Hippocrates and Gallens fountaines.</p>
            <p>As for his order, though it be not ſo exact, becauſe of his continuall practiſe and curing the ſicke, yet is it likewiſe, for a great comprehenſion of Arte, to bee commended, for the diſtribution is perpetuall whereby hee deuideth woundes into their generall differences, and into ſimple and compound, as into their braunches.</p>
            <p>Alſo the proper prognoſtications are noted, and laſtlye the perticuler method of curing added. Then which order none coulde (in my iudgement) haue beene ſette downe, or deuiſed better.</p>
            <p>After this generall Chapter, followeth that of wounds in the head. For this, becauſe of the greatneſſe of the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and worthieneſſe of the partie, offereth it ſelfe firſt.</p>
            <p>Next to that, are the wounds of the breaſt and bellie, in ſuch ſort deliuered, that nothing can bee further wiſhed, to the knowledge, either of their daunger or healing. The reſt of wounds inflicted vppon other partes then thoſe, are either comprehended vnder his ſimple wound, or elſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of the aucthor as ouer light to bee written off. The temperature, placing, knitting, ſubſtance, figure, action, and vſe of euerie affected part, he handleth in a certaine additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of phiſicke to the end of this booke.</p>
            <p>Which is notable in this, that almoſt no accident can happen to a wound, but from thence may bee found a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb facs="tcp:306:12"/> way of curing the ſame.</p>
            <p>But to come againe to his chirurgerie, his wounds being finiſhed, he propoundeth the curing of vlcers, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in one onely Chapter.<note place="margin">Heere vvas ſome ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, for there are ii. or three Chapters thereof.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And heere I thinke good to admoniſh, that the ſame Chapter is all but a matter of remembrance, and as a thing taken out of his table, notes of memorie in like ſort, as are alſo moſt bookes of Hippocrates that are carried about. Where hence it commeth that neither all things are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor yet encloſed in the walles of method, and yet euerie where a perfect curation ſhineth foorth. But this breuitie is recompenced with a fine curation of the french diſeaſe: in which this is notable, that he ſheweth the true man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of decocting Salſa Parilla, taught heretofore by no man. All which things are declared with a briefe expoſition vpon euerie Chapter. But to ende my Epiſtle as I began, you ſhall do a worke worthie your condition, if, as you are example to others in wiſedome and holy life, you doe alſo helpe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men in this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie.</p>

For of the roundneſſe of the head and of the place in the which the wound is, by ſure coniecture and reaſon the depth is taken. Therefore if the wounde bée déepe and inward, it is to bée framed forthwith and faſhioned, neyther ſhall it bée néede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to cut the head ouerth wart. But it ſhalbe ſufficient to open the brimmes or Lippes ſo cut together, with <hi>Pericra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> on both ſides, and to confirme it into the faſhion of a Triangle, and the day following wée muſt beginne to cure the wound with that Balme, (as wée call it) being melted and warme, laying thereon an emplaiſter of <hi>Gum Elemij,</hi> but the thirde daye we muſt vſe the Trepan, but the bones are to bée boared through from the inner parte, although there bée cauſe of ſuſpition that all the panne bée cut, for out of that place all matter, corruption, and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full humours is purged. The place therefore being now opened, thou ſhalt cure the pannicles with <hi>Mell Roſarum</hi> together with the liniment (which they call Balme) to enduce the fleſh, as we haue alreadie ſet ſoorth, For by this liniment <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is more mundified, and the fleſh ſooner induced. But the whole place that is cut, is to bée anoynted with a fether, that all places may bée ſearched, and mundified, neither is the vſe of the Raſour inſtrument, which they call Legra vnprofitable and ſuperfluous in theſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:306:29"/> woundes. For ſo great a portion of the pannicles being cut away by ſhauing and paring, would receiue hurtfull aire, and neither the pannicles themſelues ſhoulde be ſo handſomelie made cleane, or gather ſo conuenient fleſh ouer them, as the ſame is beſt done by the vſe of the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan. For the wounds being cured in this order, are moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie purged, and beſt couered with fleſh. And doe caſt foorth the bones, if any be to be drawen, in manner at the ſame time, as the brooſed woundes doe. But if theſe woundes doe not in manner extend beyond the former table of the Skll, in ſuch woundes to be knowen and cured, there néedeth great iudgement and diligence, for it commeth verie often to paſſe, that theſe woundes are made of that man which knoweth not to vſe his ſwoorde ſtrongly, neither in cutting nor in wounding ſtriketh with his hande lightly, but doth rather brooſe then cut, and ſo doth hurt as if the wounde had béene made with Clubbe or Staffe, or by ſome other contuſion, by which blowe the heade is rather daſhed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then wounded, and the Skull it ſelfe through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauitie, and that part by the which it doth touch the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, is the more ſhaken and moued, then anie whit touched or cut in the vpper parte, ſo that it is more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly hurt with the ſwoorde, then if it had béene donne with a Staffe or Clubbe. It happeneth alſo that often times of that contuſion manie veines are broken, out of which the bloud that burſteth foorth is eaſilie corrupted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently not onelie the ſignes of death, but alſo verie death it ſelfe enſueth. Wherefore when anie of theſe thinges ſhall happen, it is the chiefe part of an expert Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to conſider of all theſe thinges which we haue ſpoken off, and alſo if conueniently it may be, to view the ſwoorde or other weapon wherwith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wound was made, whether it were ſharpe or blunt, &amp; alſo to conſider the man which gaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wound, whether he were more in actiuitie, or in ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, likewiſe alſo to conſider what we apon he vſed, ſharpe or
<pb facs="tcp:306:30"/> blunt, a Dagger, an axe, Darte or Iauelin, or any other, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a ſharp weapon, many things of the like ſort are to be conſidered and waied, and the ſignes alſo are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, which haue enſued in him that hath taken the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, if he did ſtraight way vomit, or if he fell downe, or whether he were in a foune, or troubled in his ſight with dimneſſe or in any other ſence, for no ſuch thing is wont to happen wher the wound is lightly receiued, and nothing elſe made then an inciſion or cut, but to take it ſo lightly that he ſeemeth to haue had the ſtripe not in the head but on the haire, &amp; that happeneth by reaſon of the light contuſion. Therefore when any ſuch thing happeneth, wheras the coniecture &amp; the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof is very difficill, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> doe think this to be the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and moſt wiſeſt way, that the place be opened with the Trepan. For we doe feare no daunger heereof, (although we finde nothing hurt within the ſkull.) I ſay, no daunger nor any delay of cure. Contrarywiſe, if this thing be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, then moſt great and moſt certaine daunger, yea and often times death it ſelfe doth enſue. And truely I do thinke that the moſt part of men which dye of any wound in the head, dye for this cauſe. For in ſuch chaunces the Surgions haue accuſtomed no other thing then to ſcrape or ſhaue, and to vſe the Legra, vntill they ſhall think that they are come to the ende of the Sciſſure, and ſo they think they haue ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied themſelues, and diſcharged their office. And when they leaſt feare, then beginneth to appeare the ſignes of death, whereof they haue ſmall knowledge, and by this meanes all doe periſh, ſo that none can eſcape theſe daungers: neither may this ſéeme a thing meruailous or incredible vnto you, ſéeing there are very few in our coaſts vnto whome the vſe of the Trepan is knowne. Although they haue long profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the arte of Phiſicke and Surgerie, for I doe heare ſaye, that the moſt part doe diſalow this order of curing, and doe condemne it as full of daunger and haſard, which doe not perceiue this thing that of two ſure inſtruments and for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:306:30"/> members moſt fit, this Trepan to be the one, which is commended eſpecially of <hi>Iohn Vigo</hi> and <hi>Guido,</hi> and of other auctors, for (that I may vſe their owne proper words) the Trepan in the cures of the head, and the Falx or hooke in the cure of the tayle is greatly allowed of them. But what this Falxe ſhould bée, or what is the vſe thereof, ſurely I take it to be a thing vtterly vnknowen vnto our countrie Surgions, and if it were at a venter and vppon the ſoddaine brought foorth before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I think it would not be knowen. But let vs retourne to our purpoſe, I doe thinck therefore that when there ſhalbe no feare of thoſe matters which are ſet foorth of vs to be obſerued in the wounds of the head, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there néedeth no other inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t beſides the vſe of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra or Raſoure inſtrument. Now therefore this inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t muſt be of thrée ſorts: a greater, a middle, &amp; a leſſe. Of which this is the vſe. If the cut ſhall pierce as déepe as the former table, or elſe déeper, then we moſt go to work with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, after that with the middle, &amp; then with the leaſt. But if the inciſion in the bone ſhalbe ſomething leſſe &amp; not déepe, it ſhalbe ſufficient to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place ſmoth &amp; plain with the leaſt. Legra: leaſt there ſhould be left ſome receſſe or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauitie, wherevnto the corrupt matter being gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might pierce. And when it could not be taken away, ſhould thereby putrifie the bone. But when this is once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, in the ſecond opening, the Balme muſt be applied, although the matter be not yet brought to his perfection, for by this medicine the corrupcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhalbe brought to his perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ripeneſſe in very good time, as we haue taught you before. After this let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place be filled with lints not to hard depreſſed, &amp; adde therevnto one of the emplaiſters which we haue ſet foorth to you before. By this meanes therefore all kindes of wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds are moſt rightly &amp; ſoneſt cured, oftentimes without any loſſe of bones, for although they are ſometimes fouched with the ayre &amp; hurt, the power of this medicine is ſo great, that if the pacient be of a good conſtitucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature, all
<pb facs="tcp:306:31"/> things be eaſily corrected &amp; reſtored, as by experience made it ſhal manifeſtly appeare, but what appertaineth to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of diet in meats and drinks, and the conuenience of the place, thus it is. If it ſhalbe in the winter ſeaſon, let his chamber be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vpper part of the houſe, in ſome high cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber if it may conueniently be, ſo that the roofe be wel fenced either with plaiſter or with Tome other lofte aboue it, and not néere the tyles onely, from the raine, for if theſe thinges may not be had it ſhalbe ſurer that his chamber be prepared in a lower place, but in So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer ſeaſon a lower chamber is beſt, leaſt the pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be hurt by heate, let the chamber doore be alwaies kept ſhutte, and hang a cloth before the doore to kéepe off the aire that commeth into the chamber. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more let there be a Candel burning in the chamber day and night, whoſe heate is ſufficient to temper the aire that is in the circuite of the chamber. But if the place doe ſéeme ſomwhat cold by reaſon of the winter, let there be burning coles brought into the chamber ſometimes, for it is not good for the chamber to be ouer hot, therefore we doe commonly vſe to haue a candle continually burning in the chamber, the dores being ſhut and a cloth continually hanging before the ſame, for it happeneth oftentimes, that thoſe which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in and out, doth neglect to ſhut the dores, many Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions haue accuſtomed to caſt a cloth ouer their heads that ſtand by, in manner of a tent, and ſo to goe about their cure: but ſurely I think that there is no néede of any ſuch things, if ſo that the place be prepared as we haue ſaid, for I thinke that oftentimes, the ſame hurteth. For the heate of the candle is reflexed, by reaſon of the cloth ſtayed againſt them, and doth not ſuffer the vapours fuming out of the pacients head to breath foorth, and it is euident that thing to be very noy-ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>me and hurtfull, and eſpecially in the hot countries, but in colde countries it may be better borne withall.</p>
                  <p>It chaunceth oftentimes in the warres déepe wounds of mens heads in the open ayre to be cured, and without any
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:306:31"/> houſe, where neither chamber, nor ſhéete, nor fire is, therfore wée thinke thoſe thinges to be ſufficient which we haue ſpoken of touching preparing the place.</p>
                  <p>But when the time of opening is, it will be much auail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to hold two Candels aboue on both ſids of the wound, as néere as may be, that the aire enuironing the thamber, may thereby be warmed and tempered, and the ſame two candles ſhall both giue light enough, and ſhall conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kéepe of the colde that may hurt, for there ſhalbe no colde in a maner in the chamber that is thus prepared, as we haue tolde you, and if thou ſuſpect that there is any, the candles being remoued to and fro about the pacient ſhall remedie all that matter, which thing ſurely verie experirnce doth teach vs.</p>
                  <p>In the verie beginning of the cure, we doe féede them which are diſeaſed of any wound in the head with ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and a little bread both at dinner and ſupper, and with water of Aniſe and Barley, or with that which ſhall ſéeme beſt to agrée with the complexion of the pacient, and we vſe this diet vntil the ſeuenth daye, except neceſſitie doth enforce any other thing either in the matter it ſelfe, or growing of any other forren cauſe. But if the partie be of a cholericke complexion to ſuffer him once a day to eate the fleſh of a pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let or cockerell, vntil he haue paſſed the ſeuenth day, but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to forbed all ſuch as ſuffer any ſuch griefes to eate the broth of the fleſh, becauſe it is wont to hurt very much: from the beginning of the cure we doe giue him to drinke euerie day in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning the ſirope of Roſes made by infuſion. ℥.ii. mixed with Plantain water. ℥.iii. and this we cauſe to be giuen vii. daies together. We muſt alſo diligently foreſée that euery day he goe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtoole whether it be of his owne courſe or prouoked by ſome Cliſter. But we exhibite no medirine purgatiue, nor yet Caſſia. For that wée haue obſerued by often proofes, that thing to be hurtfull to them verie greatlie, although it bée a verie ſimple medicine and haue no
<pb facs="tcp:306:32"/> ſolutiue at all admired. If any man ſtande in doubt or will contende to the contrarie, he ſhall finde it by proofe. For whereas the head is the chiefeſt member, it cannot be but that it ſhould be troubled of the purgatiue medecine, by reaſon of the communitie which the brayne hath with the bellie, wherevpon it commeth to paſſe, that it can doe no good but hurt verie much, and ſurelie this order theſe fiftie yéeres hath hadde good ſucceſſe with vs alwaies, whereas before that time it did ſo well take place according to our expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as long as we did accuſtome to giue <hi>Casfia fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae</hi> to the patient, it ſhalbe ſufficient therefore with the vſe of theſe ſirupes to atteunate the humours, to temper the heate, and refreſh the ſtrength, to helpe the vertue concoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of the bellie and the liuer, and to repreſſe the boyling of the bloud, and of other humours. But when the fracture of the bone is not certaine, yet it is to be ſuſpected that there is ſome ſecret rupture or bloud effuſed out of the veines, which being corrupted, may cauſe death. This thing wée may with certaine experience finde out by a certaine Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leote compoſed which we will declare after the mind of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilpalia</hi> although it be not plainely ſet foorth of the ſame author.</p>

                  <p>It happened vnto vs in the Towne of <hi>Fraxenall,</hi> that we did cure a man whoſe face was wounded with a ſwoorde, from the verie ioyning of the noſe &amp; browes, to the top and opening of the lippes on hooh ſides, ſo that the noſe with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vpper Iawbone and teeth, fell downe vpon his chame, but they that waited vpon him at home did vſe themſelues ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When we came thether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent for, we founde that part, I ſay, the noſe &amp; the Iaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone now cold &amp; almoſt dead, ſo that a néedle might ſcantlie perce, yet we ſet the whole place together with a néedle, &amp; ſo that the bones of the vpper Iawe did agree within to his own bones, as nature requireth. And y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we did after this ſore.</p>
                  <p>We honnd a fillet two fingers brode about his forehead, which had on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nether part a hem, wherunto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thrid might be ſtrongly faſtned, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

In the ſame maner there was a man likewiſe cured of vs, whome a Bull had ſtroken, and with his horne vnder the chin from the eare to the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per iaw, had opened that part of the face alſo which doth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate the left eye from the noſe, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tippe of the horne (as they which were there preſent &amp; eſpecially the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did affirme) eppeared foorth more then tenne fingers breadth, we did ſow vp the place with a néedle where the horne went in and where it came foorth alſo. But we bound vp the chaw, as it hath bene declared in the former cure, and healed it outwardly according to the order of our precept, &amp; gaue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, that his mouth within ſhould be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a decoction of Barly, Roles, &amp; the flowers of Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granades, &amp; Mell Roſatid, ſtrained &amp; mingled therewithall. And ſo in a very ſhort time he was cured, yet many bones falling from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roofe of his mouth which were broken with the horne, &amp; there was left in the roofe of his mouth a hole as great as the Thumb of a mans hand might go in, when all things were healed, &amp; the ſkin couered, we ſtopped the hole ouer with a ſmoth rine and made fit artificially to the place with a linnen cloth alſo wrapt about it, by which meanes it was prouided that hée might ſpeake, eate &amp; drinke well, yet he did foreſée that in the night time it ſhould be taken away leaſt the hole thereby ſhould be made wider, &amp; ſome times he layde it aſide.

Wherefore we haue thought it good to ſette foorth that order of curing which we vſe in thoſe kinde of wounds, and wherby we doe cure all wounds which are brought to vs when they be gréene ſo they be not deadly of neceſſitie, ſuch as are ſette foorth by writers percing the Diaphragma, and the ſtomake: all theſe wounds are of manifeſt daunger to euery man, and are ſo reconed of the learued Doctors euerie where, but all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other (although the bodie be perced through) yet by Gods help they may be healed. Of which ſort it hath happened vnto vs to heale by his help innumerable, as well taken at the firſt in hand, as alſo forſaken of otheres, and that within the fortith day. And the ſame thing ſhall happen to any Phiſition which will follow the order to be ſet foorth by vs, whether they be gréene wounds and new, or of longer continuance and forſaken of others, neither ſhall he néede the help of manie hands to the matter. The common opinion almoſt of all our writers is, that all wounds receiued in the déepe breſt, be for the moſt part incurable.

                  <p>Of which ſort are Noonnes, &amp; others that haue choſen a continent and ſingle life, they doe happen alſo to men, but that ſeldome. The healing of theſe ſéemed to vs worthie to ſette downe in writing in this booke, becauſe it is a great deale more
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:306:49"/> eaſie to thoſe that ſhall know it well, then as the auncient writers haue ſet it foorth, where vpon this is a common ſong euerie where almoſt among all the Phiſitions of our time, that the ſecret or hidden cancer is not healed at anis time, but if it be to be cured, they iudge it neceſſarie to vſe the pallatiue cure, as they call it, and that it ought not to bée cut off, which thing if it had béene put downe in the cancer exulcerate, if had béene well ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>For to ſuch exulcerate cancers the pallatiue cure onely profiteth. For if they bée cured otherwiſe, a more preſent and aſſured daunger is to be feared. For they are woont to bée eaten away and conſumed a great deale ſooner by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to medicines, eſpecially if corroſiue medicines be layd therevnto, or by any meanes it happen any bloud to bée powred out of them.</p>
                  <p>But to cure the reſt which are not erulcerate, it is not ſo hard a matter as they thinke which doe ſette foorth nor teach no cure of cancers at all, nor ſhowe how they may bée drawen foorth, whereas they may notwithſtanding bée drawen foorth whole without any daunger, although it happen the ſame to be great.</p>
                  <p>But that cure of Cancers which is taught by writers, whereas their intencion is all about reſoluing the ſame, that is altogether without effecte. Which wée haue found verye often to bée in vayne, although wée haue béene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in preparing and practiſing the ſame with diuers reſolutiues.</p>
                  <p>Which ſort of remedies are taught vs of <hi>Vigo,</hi> and of <hi>Celſus, Guido,</hi> and others, wherefore howe ſuch manner of cancers maye without harme bée both drawen foorth, and alſo throughlie cured. I thought it good to put it in writing for the behouſe of the common vtilitie, and this is the bréefeſt order of curing which we ſhall teach you. Firſt of the whole curing of thoſe cancers which are not exulcerate, and ſcondly alſo of thoſe cancers which are exulcerate,
<pb facs="tcp:306:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> we will (with a verie ercellent palleatiue cure) declare, whereby we haue long prolonged many men and women, and leaſt they ſhuld for that cauſe periſh, we haue taken de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent care, and inſpecially a certaine man a prieſt we did ſo preſerue aboue xx. yéeres with this kinde of cure, that before he ended his life, he was thoroughlie cured. And when he deceaſed, he was more then foure ſcore yéeres of age, firſt at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning, the moſt certaine ſignes of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe are the encreaſing of theſe cancers bigger and bigger, for when the ſame be firſt bred, they do not excéed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a Chiche, but in a yéere or two or ſomwhat more, they become greater and harder in féeling.</p>
                  <p>There are other ſignes alſo ſet foorth of writers which ye may ſéeke for in their bookes. Therefore when wée will cut foorth the Cancer, we muſt firſt of all prepare the diſeaſed body with a purgacion, miniſtring therevnto ſuch Sirupes for foure or fiue dayes, whoſe nature is approued concoct, blacke, and aduſt colour. For of thoſe humours doth this euill firſt grow and increaſe. After this ſome purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be giuen which ſhall be iudged beſt to agrée with the complexion of the man. The third daye after the purgation, the ſecond or third houre after dinner, lette two youlkes of egges with the whites be well beaten together, adding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto if you pleaſe a little Roſe water. There ſhalbe alſo in a redineſſe great plentie of plageants made of the moſt fine two of flaxe.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, ſmall Cuſſhions or Boulſters, with a roule or fillet fiue fingers broad, and a good porcion alſo of friſe or dagſ waine, and a great roulling néedle and a good ſtrong thrid and that doubled. Let the pacient be laid bolt vpright either vppon cuſhions or elſe vpon a matris. Let there be vppon both ſides two other men which maye holde his armes ſtrongely, leaſt by ſtrength and ſtriuing he be a hinderance to himſelf whiles he is in euring. Let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Surgion ſit ouer the man, &amp; with his thighes hold in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts thighes
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:306:50"/> his owne knées, being fixed and ſurely pitched vpon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris whereon the man is laid, and let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man be naked from the girdle vpward, and a linen cloth redie on both ſides, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon which the bloud may runne downe, but the Cancer it ſelfe hold faſt with thy hands, which if it be againſt the nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the breſt, it is to be turned aſide warely, leaſt the paps ſhould periſh when it is cut off, but if it be toward the armepit, it is to be diuerted alſo, leaſt any of thoſe muſcles which riſe from the arme-holes, ſhould be periſhed, or hurt, but when the Cancer ſhall be thus ordered and caught faſt with the left hande, let ſo much of the ſkin be opened with a verie fine Raſor, as the Cancer is, let the opening of the ſkinne be made in length, after that vpon the other ſide of the Cancer, let the fleſh be cut away and ſeperated, but ſo the Cancer be not ſtriken.</p>
                  <p>But if the bloud doe burſt out, the place is to be ſtopped with a little round ball of ſilke, which (if it be néedefull to be done) let the one of them which holdeth his armes, kéepe downe with his finger, and parte the fleſh from the Cancer on the other ſide. But this péece of worke requireth moſt ſpéedie diſpatch of the Surgion, yet notwithſtanding ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with great diligence and héede taking, and materite, leaſt he ſhould offend in any thing vnaduiſedly. But when the Cancer is detected on both ſides, and parted from the fleſh, let him be thruſt through with a néedle and thred, let it be committed to one of them that ſtandeth by, of whome it muſt be holden ſtreite, lifting vp his hande, and to bée turned both on the one ſide and the other againſt that part which the Surgion cutteth. But when the Cancer ſhalbe well ſeperated on both ſides from the other fleſh, it is vtterlie to be cutte off from the nether parte, and that with the moſt expedicion that may bée, putting to our fingers, that the whole Cancer may be perceiued to bée cutte off, and nothing to bée left behynde. And that may be done verie well with that kynde of knife which
<pb facs="tcp:306:51"/> the Italian Surgions vſe to open Apoſtumations, the faſhion whereof is like the ſcarifying knife, but it hath a ſharpe edge on both ſides, but we muſt vſe the edge that is bowed in, and hauing a moſt ſharpe point, for that part doth more commodiouſly cut of thoſe things which are beneath, and that is done with no hurt either of breaking out of the bloud, or any other thing, and we will that the operation be ſo ſwift that there be more delaye in thruſting the cancer through and in knitting the thrid, then in plucking out of the ſame. When the cancer is vtterly cut off and drawen away, we muſt ſearch diligently that there be nothing left behinde in the body thereof, but it is ſo hard, that that thing is ſeldome to be feared, when all things are diſpatched, let all the bloud which was in the wound be diligently wipte away, and foorthwith put in Pleageants dipt in the white of an egge, but yet ſo that they be not to hard preſſed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to augment the griefe of the pacient, neither is the place within wholely to be ſtopped with ouer thicke thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of pleageants: then is the place artificially to be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vp with conuenient rowling and boulſters.</p>
                  <p>The next daye after at the ſame time he is to be opened, &amp; to be dreſſed with a digeſtiue, or with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our balme whoſe effect is great to concocte, mundifie, and to enduce fleſhe, which is done by anointing the place with a fether gently, adding there vnto dried lints, yet not to hard preſſed together, that the fleſh may by little and little grow together, and cloſe vppe.</p>
                  <p>But aboute the wound it ſelfe, and on the pappe there muſt bée added a defenciue confected of Roſe water, waxe and Bole <hi>Armoniacke,</hi> but with the vſe of that Balme which wée haue tolde you off, the wound will moſt ſpedilie be cured, and the fleſh brought ouer and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but vppon the Balme, wée put the plaiſter <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon</hi> ſpred vppon linnen cloth. At the laſt when the fleſh ſhalbe ſufficientlie enduced, the place is to bée dreſſed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:306:51"/> with drie lints and <hi>Baſilicon</hi> layed thereon or the plaiſter called <hi>Leoninum,</hi> or of the plaiſter compounded of <hi>Gummi Elemij,</hi> but whatſoeur plaiſter it be, it is to be wiped and made cleane oftentimes euerie day, but for the vlcered Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers there is no other cure but the pallatiue, for whatſoeuer thou ſhalt laye there vnto it will hurt greatlie, but in this kinde of Cancer this is the order of curing, let him which is troubled with this diſeaſe at certaine times in the yéere when it ſhall ſéeme good, be purged.</p>
                  <p>After that euerie moneth let him vſe two or thrée pilles purging blacke choler, in the night about that ſeaſon that hée goeth to reſt. But thoſe <hi>Pillula</hi> are beſt <hi>de fumarie, vel de Heleboro, vel de Lapides lazuli, vel Epithimi, vel Fetidae,</hi> or thoſe which are <hi>de nitro</hi> ſet forth by <hi>Alexander Tralianus,</hi> for by theſe, the body is kept pure, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is rather deminiſhed then increaſed, but in the wounde it ſelfe wée put vnguentum <hi>Pompholiogos,</hi> or that which is ſet foorth of <hi>Iohn Vigo</hi> in his Antidotary, we vſe that with out lints ſpred vppon a linnen cloth, for we do find that the little thrides of the lint doe hurt, for if they cleaue ſomewhat to the wound, they make it bléede, &amp; the ſame bloud doth hurt. Finally, this vnguent chieflie is that which we haue alwaies founde moſt auailable for this purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>That diſeaſe which is called the Leproſie, corrupting or infecting the whole body, if the ſame light in any one part of the body, it is termed a Canker. As <hi>Galen</hi> ſaieth in his ſecond <hi>ad Glauconem,</hi> you muſt vnderſtand that this name of Canker among Phiſitions hath diuers ſignifications, and beareth the name of two ſeuerall diſeaſes, namely a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Canker, as well growing in the outward part, as in the inward part of the body, lurking and as it were ling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.

                     <p>For ſaith he, it is better not to ſéeke to cure the Canker that lurketh or lieth ſtill, for by curious curing of that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, the partie moſt commonly is kilde.

                     <p>For doth not our aucthor cure thoſe cankers which bréede in the ſuperficiall or outward partes of the body by cutting. Which <hi>Auicen</hi> alloweth off &amp; <hi>Galen</hi> before his time, but not the lurking or hidden cankers, hée cureth in that manner.</p>

The bowelles which doe appeare or hang foorth, and the <hi>zirbe</hi> alſo is firſt of all to be waſhed with a decoction <hi>Vini Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille, Melliloti, Abſinthij, aneti, Roſarum.</hi> And afterward to be brought and redueed into their owne place, but the part of the <hi>zirbe</hi> which hangeth foorth, is yet to be drawen far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out ſomewhat, and vpon that part as it is equall with the ſkinne of the bellie, it is to be bounde faſt with a ſure thred, with that knot that is called <hi>Suillus,</hi> or the ſwines knot, or the chifterling knot, for it is a very ſure knot, the which doth not ſlip at any time, but aboue the knot let the <hi>zerbe</hi> be out off halfe a ſingers bredth, and let the ſection be cauterized with a hot iron vntill it almoſt touch the knot, and let it be put in againe ſtraight waies, and ſome parte of the ſtring be left hanging foorth, but if the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the wound be ſomewhat great, let it be artifically ſtitched vp, leauing an orifice whereby the ligature may come foorth, and the cure finiſhed. But of the foure waies whereby writers doe teach how thoſe parts called <hi>Mirach</hi> &amp; <hi>Sipach,</hi> ought to be ſowed vp, all that is moſt allowed of vs, and by daylye practiſe and vtilitie moſt commended, that is to ſay, that firſt <hi>Mirach</hi> and <hi>Siphach</hi> being thruſt through
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:306:54"/> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> néedle on thone part, <hi>Mirach</hi> onely be thruſt through on tother part, and let theſe thrée be faſtened with a knot, and then let the thrid be cut, and of that part where their worke is begun, let <hi>Mirach</hi> onely be thruſt through, <hi>Siphach</hi> being left, but on the other part <hi>Mirach</hi> and <hi>Siphach</hi> being thruſt through, let the ſecond knot be made, and the third ſtitch and then the fourth, and ſo foorth vntill the worke be finiſhed. And ſo by this meanes <hi>Mirach</hi> and <hi>Siphach</hi> are ioyned beſt together, ſo that neuer afterward the bowells can ſtart foorth any moore vpon that part, which thing often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hath bene founde to happen, except the cure be done, as we haue toulde you. When theſe thinges are thus dulie done, the white of eggs well beaten together is to be put thereto, neither ſhall it be néedefull to vſe any tent, the place whereoff that Ligature wherewith <hi>Zirbus</hi> is bounde vp together doth ſupply. But the next daye after the wound is to be dreſſed with a Flammula dipt in that our balme, whoſe force is to concoct, to munditie, and to bring ouer the fleſh. Laying thereon the emplaiſter <hi>Baſilicon Maciſtrale</hi> or <hi>Minium,</hi> for both thoſe are very good. But this is to be confidered both in great wounds, and alſo in ſmall, for thoſe that are ſomewhat narrow muſt be concocted and digeſted alſo as well within as without. But it ſhall not be néede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to vſe either oyle of Roſes or any other oyle. The third day after or at the fartheſt the fourth day, the Ligature doth ſlake of his owne accord. And if then the corrupcion doe not abound, it ſhalbe ſufficient to vſe one of thoſe emplaiſters, if there ſhalbe any matter, it is to be wiped away oftentimes in the daye, and by this meanes the cure ſhalbe diſpatched within the xv. day, but in the very firſt beginning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cure, it ſhalbe conuenient to let bloud, according to the diſpoſition or ſtate of the pacient, and to giue him <hi>Sirupi Roſarum ex infuſione, cum Aqua Plantaginis,</hi> &amp; let the order of his diet be ſle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a little bred, but not very much water is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him, &amp; the ſame to be decocted with an hot glowing iron.</p>

But oftentimes it commeth to paſſe that to ſuch kinde of men their cure doth not proſper according to their minde, in which thing when all there common remedies being aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are in vaine, this one thing is a common refuge at the laſt for them all, that they ſend men awaie being ſpoiled of their mony, with a plaiſter of <hi>Diacilon</hi> which they call <hi>Socrocium,</hi> as if they were vtterly whole.</p>
                  <p>And would to God the ſame reward of their vnperfect cure, did not paſſe the eſtimation of a moſt perfect cure: we haue ſéene many of that ſorte of men which do not ceaſe to ſet foorth with great bragges ſuch their cures, or rather corruptions, declaring their names to whom they haue done the ſame. But the fault of this miſchiefe is in the publique Maieſtrates. But how all ſuch woundes are wont to be cured of them, is eſpecially to be noted of vs. Whether the wound therefore be made with ſword or lance, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pach their firſt cure with ſtitching.
<pb facs="tcp:306:58"/> but ſome of them are ſo hard hearted in this pointe, and ſo cruell, that they hurt more with ſowing, then he that gaue the wound with ſtricking. For vſing groſſe needles they doe take more holde of the fleſh then nedeth a great deale, the orifices of the wounds being wreſted from their courſe, they leaue mumled together after that they haue made their knotes. For the ſkin is by this meanes cloſed to the ſkin, but not the fleſh to the fleſh, becauſe they place the ſkin in the mideſt betwéene the fleſh, and many times alſo they take vp the ſkinne ſo lightlie and from the very vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſide, that the orifice of the wound doe not ioyne.</p>
                  <p>For the extreme partes being ſet together, the reſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine hollow and emptie, by theſe and ſuth like meanes, their firſt cure is alwaies finiſhed</p>
                  <p>But if it happen by chaunce that any bones be cut, albeit all be not looſed, yet doe they vtterly draw foorth the ſame with no ſmall griefe to the patient, but with verie great hurt vnto him, abuſing that ſentence common among them (but not well vnderſtoode) to cut of the ſuperfluitie, And alſo if any of the fleſh be cut and yet not cleane cut off, they notwithſtanding cut it cleane away, affirming that it is not to be receiued of nature, and eſpetiallie if the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bee in the hand, although part of the fingers doe in ſome part cleaue faſt vnto the fleſh and the bones being cut, they alwaies cut it off.</p>
                  <p>For they thinke that it cannot be by any meanes, that the bone being cut may grow together.

Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this is a common thing to all vlcers after the minde of <hi>Galen,</hi> that at all times they require drying medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines and abſterſiue. For all vlcers generally doe abound with a double fault of humidite, thone humidite is groſſer, and thother more ſubtile and thinner. Theſe faults except they be corrected, the vlcers cannot be healed.</p>
                  <p>It is a great matter alſo to take héede leaſt ſuch drying medicines which are néedefull in the curing of vlcers be not to hot, leaſt that part be ouer heated, of the exceſſiue diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature.

And it is no leſſe to be eſchewed that wée vſe not ouer colde medicines, if any ſuch of neceſſitie muſt be applied. For the natiue coulour being debilitated with this kinde of medicine, is an occaſion of the corrupcion of the member and vlcer. And of that thing this is a token, that the verie coulour about the Vlcer is more blacke and darcker.</p>

But if the vlcers be hot, vppon the pouder and lintes we vſe the oyntment <hi>Lythargirium,</hi> and we vſe this pouder ſo longe till the vlcer be purged and mundified which the very ſight of the fleſh and the coulour doth eaſily ſhew. For the coulour in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh is read and ſhining, and in the which there appeareth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine grained thing to the likenes of the graines of a Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate. And there is ſéene alſo matter and that pure and good. Furthermore it is knowne alſo by this token, when the plaiſter is remoued from the vlcer, if the pouder doe cleaue faſt to the vicer together with the lintes, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that iſſueth foorth be little or none at all, and be like the thin ſpittell; that thing is a ſigne of mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>difiyng and cleanes in the vlcer. When the vlcers are ordered in this manner, we doe put thereon the plaiſter called of vs <hi>Leonatum</hi> ſpred vppon cloth, the pouder whereof is ſuch, that if ther remaine any filthineſſe behinde, it doth purge it foorth, nor yet doth ſuffer the fleſh to grow any farther then is néede, &amp; alſo doth meruailoſly cicatrize the vlcer. This is to be wipte &amp; made cleane oftentimes in the day, but eſpecially if it draw much corrupcion from the vlcer. But generally this cerote doth helpe colde vlcers, or placed in a cold part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie. But if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vlcers be hot, in ſtéede of that cerote we applie the black plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which is the very beſt ſurely in this kinde. And it ſhall auaile alſo to wipe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> often times.

And by theſe meanes the vlcers which are neither olde
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:306:65"/> nor hard, are wont to be cured. But if ſuch kinde of vlcers be olde, cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the ſureſt meanes to cure ſuch kindes of vlcers, is to vſe burning and caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing, all the corrupt fleſh being firſt cut off which is in them, but the hidden cauernes (if there be any) muſt bée made manifeſt and opened, and the vtter partes of the vlcer cut awaie. Neither is it néedefull to the diſpaching of this matter, that the pacient be either bound or holden of many, but in this order it ſhalbe expedient for you to doe. Whether the vlcer be in the ſhinne or in any other part, the bodie being with ſome commodius medicine purged, let the man that is the pacient be ſet downe in ſome long ſeat, (as on a forme or ſuch like) the legge whereon the vlcer is, being layd along vppon the ſeat behind the pacient, let another man ſit downe, on whoſe legges the pacient may lye with his head, his necke, and his ſhoulders, and let him haue his armes to holde, and let a third man ſitte downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the thigh of the pacient, &amp; hold his legge with his hands, and there ſhall néede no more. But let the cauterizing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument be an inch thicke made in the facion of an Oliue bone which are called <hi>Oliuaria.</hi> With the which the vlcer is to be cauterized, as much as ſhalbe thought good.

                  <p>But the fillet or rouller is to be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about on both ſides of the vlcer with both your hands, and by this meanes all the corrupcion is preſſed out. And ſo the vlcer being bound vp, is left vntill the next daye, in which daye, the Ligature being looſed, we doe meaſure how much hollowneſſe hath bene left, that we throughly may ſée whether there be any place, which the ſtuphes haue not comen vnto.</p>

At length after one moneth when I was ſent for of maiſter <hi>Mondoſus</hi> (which by the kings commaundement was maiſter ouer the accompts and works, and all the mettalls) to ſée the man, I commanded him to be brought to <hi>Llarena,</hi> (where vppon a common fée I did practiſe Phiſicke) foraſmuch as it was néedefull to pluck foorth a great part of his bone, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding by reaſon of the narrower opening of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, could not be brought foorth. And wheras I did refuſe to open ſo much, I made an orifice with the Trepan, to the greatnes of a ſiluer mony called a Roiall, ſo that the membrane dyd appeare, and the filthie matter which was corrupted &amp; made from day to day, might be purged at that part, and ſo by that Balme of mée ſet foorth, and the emplaiſter of <hi>Gummi Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi> and lints, I did ſo long procecute in the cure, vntill I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode by prouing with my inſtruments, that the bone was cleane ſeperated away on euery ſide, and <hi>Dura mater</hi> to conciſt with fleſh ouer couered.

The ſpace betwéene the holes I breake off with the Leuatorie, which yelded as I brake
<pb facs="tcp:306:84"/> it very eaſilie, when I had now diſpatched theſe thinges, firſt of all lifting vp one of theſe foure porcions with my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, I drew it out, and then another, and ſo the third.

After this when he began to mend, he departed to <hi>Cazzalla,</hi> of whom after a moneth I was ſent for, becauſe his head about the bone of the hinder part he had a great ſwelling and full of corruption, which when I had opened, I found bones which were corrupted a great deale more then thoſe that were ſpoken off before. Then I bad him come to me to <hi>Llerena.</hi> The next day after artificiallie I drew out thrée bones as great as thoſe wer before, but much more corrupt. And ſo he was left lacking all the bone in the hinder part of the head in a manner, and no ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion alſo of the other ſide of the left bone. But the wounds were couered with ſkinne and fleſh on euery ſide, but yet of a tender and ſoft conſtitution, which by little and little wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hard. And the man himſelfe is well, being thus deliuered by the benefit of God.</p>

Before that I came thether after I was ſent for, I did coniecture by thoſe things that happened after, great abundance of bloud guſhing out of all partes of the wound, to haue runne into the holowneſſe of the bodie. But that bloud could not come foorth, becauſe the wound being couered with the ſkinne and the fleſh, did penetrate down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which way it is very like that the fluxes did alſo tend. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt opening of the dagger was déeper the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the blood might well breake foorth. So I when I had begun my firſt cure, nor could finde no direct going downe, would haue thought that it had penetrate no more then the reſt. After I had ſerched the place more diligently, and thruſt in my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I perceiued that the wound did go downe farther then I could follow with my finger. Therefore when I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that the wound did penetrate to the concauite, I ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the place ouer againſt the ribbes cutting the ſkinne and the fleſh directly againſt it, ſo that putting in my finger I might eaſely come to the innermore parts, and touch alſo the lights which is nert the back bone. But he was cured in that order as I haue ſhewed you in the penetrating wounds of the breaſt, and at the firſt dreſſing there was no corrupcion or matter made, but a certaine ſmall humiditie did iſſue foorth, but the fourth day water of a ſanguine coulour flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out as that is in the which fleſh is waſhed, and dayly as his dreſſings dyd follow, it came out more abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dantly, ſo that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:306:85"/> euerie dreſſing it did fill a veſſell which they call a ſaucer, and that it might iſſue out the better and more ſpéedelie, I had the pacient to cough and holde in his breath, hée was dreſſed of me foure times a day, and beſide that which ranne out at euery dreſſing, the iſſue ſtayed not day nor night, ſo that his bed was like a ſinke or ditch. Therfore at the fourth day when I perceiued ſuch fluxe of water to continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any token of matter, I did determine to giue the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that water ſet forth by vs in the laſt example. And by and by aſſoone as he began to drinke thereof, by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall ſpace of twelue daies, a greater abundance of water or mattrie ſubſtance came foorth without any hurt of the man or any great féeling, but ſo that the ſecond day it came foorth ſomewhat white and liquid.</p>
                  <p>But the thirde day a great deale whiter vntill it came foorth ſo white and thicke, cleauing faſt to the veſſell wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was receaued, that it would ſkantly runne out being turned downe, but it ranne foorth euerie day leſſe and leſſe vntill the xii. day, in the which at length it ſtinted, and the entrance of the wound did ſodenly cloſe vppe in the vtter parte thereof, which although I did oftentimes open with my inſtrumentes, yet did it ſend foorth neither matter, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch humor, neither came the breath foorth there as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſo the cure procéeded, the pacient being yet poſſeſſed with a continuall feuer.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore thrée daies together, I added to that water of whole barly, and Raiſons bruſed with their kirnells, and of <hi>Tamarinds. ℥.ij.</hi> And by this meanes the feuer ware away. The tenth day after I found the man troubled with great paine in the breſt, and with a feuer.

For it is vnpoſſible for the time that any man hath this diſeaſe, he ſhould begette any iſſue.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Againe, when the patient maketh water, in the verie water it ſelfe ſomething ſtayeth beſide the <hi>Caruncle,</hi> which cannot well be put foorth or expelled, except the roote of the yarde be preſſed hard with the pacientes finger.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Moreouer, the vrine it ſelfe in this caſe commeth not foorth with a direct and ſtraight courſe, but a ſlope and in crooked ſort either on this ſide, or elſe on that, yea and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it is deuided as it were into two ſtreames. For if the Caruncle be on the nether ſide of the yarde, then the vrine comming foorth, bendeth ſomething vpwardes. If the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vncle be on the vpper part thereof, then doth the vrine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline his courſe downeward. If it bée on the right ſide of the yarde, then the vrine bendeth toward the left ſide. If on the left ſide of the yarde, then contrariewiſe, it yéeldeth it ſelfe toward the right ſide. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Caruncle poſſeſſeth the bredth of the vrinarie paſſage, as it were ouerthwart it, then in the comming foorth, it deuideth it ſelfe into two ſtreames or courſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6 It chaunceth alſo oftentimes that the vrinarie paſſage is ſo ſtopped and choked, that the vrine being not able to vſe his ordinarie courſe and iſſue, breaketh foorth by other waies, and in this caſe nature ſéeketh woonderfull ſhiftes to helpe her ſelfe, for I haue knowen many that haue made their water betwéene their codds, and ſome againe haue done it at their fundament, and other ſome, out by their flankes and partes called in Latin <hi>Ingume.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 Yet againe there is a very good argument of the

               <p>If ye put in the ſearcher or probe, for ſo I will call the long pipe or Siring, or <hi>Catheter,</hi> by which the vrine is wont to be conuaied out, if, I ſay, you put this ſearcher into the vrinarie cundite, &amp; if then it cannot get through, but findeth a certaine ſtay or ſtoppe which is in déede the tumor or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcle it ſelfe, beyond the which you cannot paſſe, without a certaine rub, or iump as it were of the inſtrument, then it is to be ſuſpected to be a Caruncle. Now ſir, when for the great ſtraitneſſe of the place or paſſage, nothing of the vrine can be preſſed or gotten foorth, or elſe if any thing doe come foorth, yet is it onely taht which is the thinneſt. Then it is very likely, that the bladder is ſtuffed and filled with great ſtore of clammy and ſlymy ſuperfluities, which being cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the vrine to the very necke, there ſticking and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, they doe make the greater obſtruction.</p>

               <p>The other way is more gentle and eaſie, and without al daunger, which is not done by the violence of iron or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes, but by the operation and wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and this way the olde writers did not know. And of this we will ſpeake at this time.</p>
               <p>If then we haue a patient in this order troubled, his body would be ſkilfully, and ſufficiently prepared, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacuated, and his good diet and order of lyfe preſcribed. And in this poynt the pacient muſt altogether bée directed and ruled, by ſome dſſcrete and learned Phiſition. Who muſt altogether chaunge the ſame according to the varietie of the conſtitution, and other circumſtances of the pacientes body. For it is not ynough to make him looſe bellied, or to giue him many ſtooles, as the common and fooliſh opinion thinketh, but he muſt be able to varie and chaunge his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine according to the age, the ſex, the temperature, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor offending in the pacientes body, and ſuch other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:306:88"/> And therefore eſpecially the common and raſh dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings either with ordinarie pilles, or with vſual electuaries, which are alwaies redy made in the ſhoppes in this caſe, muſt altogether be auoyded. And you muſt neuer attempt to purge or moue the humor, but with good dauiſe. And with ſome ſuch proper purgation deuiſed for the purpoſe, as may both reſpect the humors offending, and alſo the place affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And therewithall in no reſpect enflame and chafe the bodie, as the common electuaries giuen at aduenture doth. For as no one ſalue, can agrée with euerie perſon, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>This point therefore of this cure muſt bée refered to the diſcretion of the Phiſition. And this once being done, the firſt thing after to be done is this.</p>
               <p>To take a fine tender Mallow ſtalke, or a ſmallage or Parſely ſtalke, for alwaie it is beſt to beginne with the moſt gentell and eaſie thinges, &amp; anoynting it with oyle of ſwéete Almonds, tenderly and ſoft to make proofe of the necke of the bladder, hauing good regard, that in no caſe, you prouoke much, or paine extremely, thoſe partes of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that bée ſo ſenſible, whereby oftentimes vnnaturall ſheuerings and ſhakinges, daungerous agues, and great fluxes of bloud, and other grieuous accidentes doe happen to follow. If it ſo fall out that the foreſaid ſtalke chaunce to paſſe without any force or great paine, ſo farre as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite of the bladder, then may we thereby coniecture, that the Caruncle is not of any great quantitie, or much growen. And therefore there is the better hope to be had of the cure. But if it chaunce to ſticke by the way, ſo that it eyther doe bend, or offer to breake, then is it to be drawen out againe foorthwith, and the Caruncle to be mollified, and relaxed by ſuch diſcret ordinarie meanes, as it may become more ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and ready to yéelde and giue place to the probe or ſearcher. <note place="margin">the way to molifi the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncle.</note> It may be mollified by fomentations, by collyries, and by emplaiſters appointed &amp; preſcribed for the purpoſe.

And that it may goe from the roote of the yarde, to the capacite of the bladder, the ſtalke that muſt bée put in, muſt be a ſpanne long and two inches at the leaſt. If by this meanes the Caruncle will not yéelde, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne obſtinate and rebellious againſt the ſearcher or
<pb facs="tcp:306:90"/> ſtalke, then a waxe Candle muſt bée put in, and that of ſuch bigneſſe, as the vrinarie condite may eaſilie receiue it. But for that it may be feared, leaſt if the Candle ſhoulde breake within the yard, as in winter eſpecially it may come to paſſe for the hardneſſe of the waxe, ſome porcion thereof might get into the bladder, and either ſkantly bée gotten out againe, or elſe ſhould anger and exaſperate the partes alredie painefull and exulcerated. Therefore it were to bée wiſhed that the Candle were made of a ſtrong kinde of thrid, and not onely of waxe, but of waxe and Turpentine artificially mixed together. Our Candle being thus made, when we haue ſo rebated and blunted the ende that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt, or gale, then we muſt anoynt it with oyle of ſwéet Almondes, and then ſomething bending it towarde the ſmaller ende, we muſt put it in often times into the vri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie condit. And if we perceiue once, that the Candle gette beyond the Caruncle, which is perceaued by the rubbe, or as it were a little iumpe by the way, and by the eſtimat of lenth of the portion, that is gotten in, then may we thinke that one halfe of our cure is obtained.</p>
               <p>For the Candle being compreſſed and hard helde of the Caruncle, as it were with a corde or ſtring, it will manifeſt and ſhew the place affected.</p>

               <p>If there chaunce to bée many Caruncles in the yarde, then ſo many partes of the Candle you ſhall perceaue to bée compreſt and marked, as there bée Carnoſities.</p>

Then may you make a probe or ſearcher of leade, of the length and bigneſſe. Anointing it with the foreſaid oyle, ſo to vſe it. For leade is not onely an eaſier and mitigater of paine, but alſo it hath the propertie and facultie of drying of vlcers. And beſides that alſo, with his verie waight it preſſeth them, and cauſeth them ſome thing to ſtoope and ſhrinke in.</p>
               <p>The fleſh may chaunce to be ſo hard and rebellious, that a leaden inſtrument ſhall not be able to maſter it neither, and then in that caſe, you muſt vſe a ſiluer or a golden Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theter or Siring. And yet before we doe vſe any ſuch either of ſiluer or golde, my councell is, that you doe make tryall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe, by the fore-named meanes.

For by that meanes partly, by the reaſon of the coorſe of the vrine partly by the inſtrument it ſelfe, the water paſſage wilbe enlarged and amplified. Your catheter or ſearcher of leade being drawen foorth after the long tarrying ther, if by them your worke be perfected ſo farre foorth, then muſt your can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell be put in laſt of all, and ſuffered there to remaine, till ſuch time as it doth receaue ſome print or marke by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Caruncle, and that wilbe a good help to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the medicine withall to worke the cure.

And this note that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumes bréeding néere <hi>ano,</hi> ought not to abide vntill they breake off them ſelues, but the Chirurgion ought diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to féele with his finger the place of the empoſtume, and where is found any ſoftnes, there he ought artificially to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the place that the corrupt blood be let out, leaſt <hi>Inteſti. num rectu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Sith a Fiſtulae is nothing elſe but an vlcer which cannot be dryed vp, for that cauſe it is vncurable. For no wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d nor vlcer, except they may be dried, are not to be cured. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it happeneth ſome men haue an drifice appearing only outward, pearcing through the longacion within <hi>ano,</hi> by the ſpace of an ynch or two, and beſide that another hole without not percing the longacion within. And I haue féene ſome to haue eight or niene holes on the one buttocke, and fiue or ſixe on the other. Of which none pearred the longacion but one. And I haue féene ſome haue two or thrée holes on the one buttocke, and two or thrée going down to the coddes.</p>
               <p>And ſome haue one hole or more in the one buttocke, and one or two in the other part of the yarde, percing as well the longacion, as the yarde. And in this caſe as I thinke, it is vncurable. The Fiſtulae in the yarde may be knowen, for that ſometimes the ſéedepaſſeth by the orifice, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time vrine, &amp; ſometime both together, neuertheleſſe of theſe I cured a Prieſt at <hi>Lincolne,</hi> in the houſe of M. <hi>Geffrey Scroope,</hi> that had an Apoſtume in his yard, of which as wel vrine as matter came downe to his codde, and ſometime bloud went by the paſſage of the yarde Fiſtulated, and his teſticles were ſwollen excéedingly. Therefore firſt I put v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the codde a ruptorie and made an orifice, where through came foorth both vrine and matter, whome I cured perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God be thanked: for his <hi>ano</hi> and longacion were not hurt.</p>
               <p>But yet note, that this cute is hard, therefore let the Chirurgion be verie circumſpecte to enquire diligently of the pacient if he féele at any time eyther wyndineſſe or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementes to paſſe by the orifice of the Fiſtulae, or if hée féele anye payne or heauineſſe in his heade,

               <p>Alſo tell you the patient, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this kinde of fiſtulae is ſuch, that ſometime it is opened of it ſelfe, and auoideth matter, ſometime thicke, ſometime thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And by theſe prognoſtications and tokens ſhewed vnto the patient, he will iudge you the more expert in your cure. For this note, after the opinion of <hi>Barnard</hi> or <hi>Gordon,</hi> that the nerue in <hi>ano</hi> hath affinitie with the ſtomacke &amp; brayne, and for this cauſe the patient is ſometime vexed in the head and ſtomacke.

               <p>But conſider diligently the manner of the fiſtulae, and whether it be curable or not. Yet you ought to foreſhew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pacient the hardneſſe of the cure, in that the ſickeneſſe aſketh long time of curing. For that the medicines applied thereto, may not hide long for purging of the belly, and for much moiſture going out of <hi>ano,</hi> and for many other cauſes, as the place being ſtraight, and the buttockes too great or hard, or the pacient is weake, or diſobedient in his cure, or in his diet, and many thinges you ought to inſtruct him of.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccording to the ſame reaſon and induſtrie that I haue compounded this emplaiſter cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chalciteos,</hi> which of the Palme trée I call <hi>Phemeenon,</hi> a verie commodius medicine for the conglutinating, and cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trizing of vlcers, and for the curing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations, being brought to the forme of a Cerote.</p>
            <p>Wiſhing you alſo to exerciſe your mindes, leauing the fond practiſes of <hi>Theſſalus</hi> and his Scollers, with their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, who neither know (nor will follow) the beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines by learned Phiſitions inuented, nor yet conſider that they doe conſiſt of contrary faculties. Exerciſe therfore I ſay your wits, that vſing with me the ſame methodes, ye may alſo compound medicines. Perſwading you that our elders compoſed all in déede by reaſon. For that order of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> empericks called in gréeke <hi>Periptoſis,</hi> is a very trifling Toye. I muſt therefore ſhew the reaſon of compounding the aboue ſaide meditine. For that the olde oyle, and the <hi>Adeps,</hi> haue digeſting or deuiding properties. But <hi>Chalciteos,</hi> &amp; <hi>Succus Palme</hi> doe repell and binde. Of theſe did I compound this medicine, which very many haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy vſed, for that by vſe and experyence they haue prooued it to be better then any other of that kinde. For reaſon inuenteth the compoſicion, but experience diſcerneth the vertue of the ſame. Euen as the artificiall workemanſhip alſo among the vnſkifull, winne credit. I haue more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer tempered with the former medicines <hi>Spuma Argenti,</hi> which giueth no great efficacy, whether it be to the ſimples
<pb facs="tcp:306:123"/> that repercuſſe the inflowing humours, or them that digeſt that which is alredy fixed in the inflamed partes. For it dryeth, but not ſtrongly.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I did put it as an apt medicine, into the compoſicion of the plaiſter. For it is boyled with the reſt aboue ſayd, vntil it come to ſuch a body, as will not cleaue to thy fingers. The <hi>Adeps</hi> muſt be freſh, and as olde as may be poſſible, &amp; the oyle muſt likewiſe be olde, whoſe vertue as you haue learned, is moſt nigh and like to hogges greace, ſauing that greace doth ſomewhat more heate and mollifie. And you haue heard that by age, they be come more ſubill, and doe more aptly digeſt. And therfore vnto inflamations that bring great paine to the part affected, the newer they are the milder and gentler they be.</p>
            <p>But to all other inflamations, the oldeſt are better, and looke how much older and more ſtubborne the inflamation is, ſo much the more profitable are the oldeſt, yea, they are of themſelues of force inough to cure it. so that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow no more into the inflamed part.</p>
            <p>But if any thing doe yet inflow, then muſt the medicine alſo haue a mixed vertue, euen ſuch as hath this medicine by me compoſed.</p>
            <p>And therefore did I mixe with digeſtiues <hi>Chalciteos et Palma.</hi> Knowing full well how few olde inflamations ther be to whom nothing infloweth. For by reaſon of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to them flowing, they are wonte to be protracted, and ſo become olde.

                  </gap>, et Millini,</hi> when the caſe required ſo ſtrong adſtriction.</p>
            <p>Whoſe compoſicion is a foloweth.</p>
            <p>Let therebe prepared of <hi>Adeps,</hi> which the Apothecaries call <hi>Axungia, li.ij. Olei Veteris, li.iij. Spuma Argenti, Tantundem. Chalcitidis. ℥.iiii.</hi> and thus muſt ye compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it.</p>
            <p>Let the ſkinnes of the greace be all taken away, and the reſt bruſed that it may be the better molten, which being melted at the fire, let it runne through a ſtrainer, that it may be cleaue without ſkinnes, and there muſt be of it two pound as is aforeſaide. After that, mixe with the <hi>Axun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia of Chalcidis</hi> made in fine pouder, the third part of a pound, (that is after the olde writers ℥.iiii.) and a quart of oyle, putting thereto <hi>Argenti Spuma. lib.iij.</hi> (as before is ſaid) and when they are all brought to one body by ſtrong laboring in a morter, put them altogether into a Cauldron and ſtirre them with a Spatulae of Palme trée, wherevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one bigg bough will ſuffice, that you may vſe the maſſie part of the woode in the manner of a Spatulae, for ſo men call the inſtrument wherewith they ſtirre confections, and we likewiſe for the more plainneſſe will vſe the ſame tearme.</p>
            <p>Now that which is next to the maſſie and woody parts of the bough muſt be cut off, and the ſmall and tender bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on ech part proeéeding foorth, muſt be pluct off, and the rindes or barke being firſt pilled away, that the ſcrappes or ſmall chippes put in, way with their ioyce ſtraine and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour the medicine.</p>
            <p>You muſt therefore vſe your Spatulae euen foorth with at the beginning.</p>
            <p>But the tender fragmentes of the Palme, muſt be caſt in, when the medicine is come to the forme of a Cerote,
<pb facs="tcp:306:124"/> for if you put them in at the firſt, the ioyſe of them (which we would haue to remaine) will in the boyling be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>Moreouer that part of your ſpatulae where with you ſtirre the medicine which is ſtrained, after it waxeth ſo dry, that it hath no more moiſture, muſt be cut off and caſt away, and the reſt which hath yet ioyſe therein muſt ſerue your turne. So long as it retaineth any ioyſe therein, and this may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for your vnderſtanding, to conſider that your ſpatulae muſt be gréene, and full of ſappe. For if it be dry, it auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth nothing.</p>
            <p>Let it be therefore in winter cut from the trée, the daye before, but in Sommer, the ſame day you boyle your medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
            <p>Now when your medicine is boyled, and come to that perfection, that it will not ſticke to your handes, then vſe this emplaiſter to vlcers that are hard to Cicatrize called in Latin <hi>Vlcera Cruenta,</hi> and alſo to bloudy wounds, being liquified with oyle, it helpeth very well inflamations, gouts of the féete, and paines of the ioyntes, inflamations of the ſhares, and Thima, burnings, kibes, fractures of bonnes, contuſions, and finially all affects that are called Rumatick. And many that now adayes doe cut <hi>Harniaes</hi> ſtraight after their handy worke doe vſe the ſaide emplaiſter. (Being firſt prepared with fomentacions, and <hi>cataplaſmes</hi>) and yet if you will put therein of <hi>Chalciteos. ℥.vj.</hi> (which after the olde order is halfe a pound) the medicine will thereby bée made the more apt for the conglutination of great wounds. And of more effect to ſuch as are hard to be Cicatrized.</p>
            <p>There are alſo in this booke other medicines of the ſame vertue.</p>
            <p>And yet vnto this medicine being liquified with oyle is more credit to be giuen in Rumatick affects, then to them all.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:306:124"/> It is very good as I ſayd at all times, for them that haue the goute, and griefes of the ioynts, when their paines are not great, then doe they require fomentacion, and liquefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng <hi>Cataplaſmes,</hi> in the beginning therefore of theſe griefes, and while they are yet in their augmentacion, when you haue liquified this medicine, let it coole, then ſcraping it with a Sciſe, power it into a morter, &amp; power wine theron, and that it may the better drinke in the ſame, worke it well with your handes againſt the morter.</p>
            <p>The wine muſt be ſomwhat tarte, and of meane age, and of ſubſtance not thicke, but as cléere as may be. For ſuch wine by reaſon that it is of a ſubtill qualitie, perceth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per into the body. And ſo long muſt you power in your wine to the melted medicine, and worke it with your handes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be taken in and tempered with the ſame, and that none of the liquor be left vnmixed with the mollified medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. Alſo if you will mixe your liquors with the medicine while it is yet warme and molten, it will be the better.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in the beginning of inſlamations, the reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſiue vertue muſt be the ſtronger. But in the augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, the ſame muſt be deminiſhed, and the vertue digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue muſt be increaſed. And moreouer when the inflamed tumor commeth to his proper ſtate and vigor, the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both repercuſſiue, and digeſtiue, muſt be of equall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porcion, vnleſſe ſome vehement paine, ſhall require a line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue medicine.</p>
            <p>But when the inflamation once declineth, you ſhall augment the vertue digeſtiue, but then ſhall you mixe no wine with your medicine.</p>
            <p>Furthermore while it melteth, if you will haue it more aſtrictiue, you muſt adde there-vnto Spaniſh Oyle, or <hi>Oleum Omphacinum,</hi> which wée call Crude or vnripe oyle.</p>
            <p>But when you deſire to haue both the faculties equall, you may liquifie it with ſwéete oyle, which muſt neither be
<pb facs="tcp:306:125"/> too new nor to olde.</p>
            <p>But if you deſire to haue it digeſt, you may very well take olde oyle. And when you melt this emplaiſter, this rule is to be obſerued, that ye take more plenty of the oyle then of the medicine. So that if you take of the oyle li.i. (that is ℥.xii.) it will ſuffice to put therevnto of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines ℥.x.</p>
            <p>So that ye may plainely perceaue, that how much the more of the medicine this plaſter hath, ſo much the more effectuous it is made thereby. And looke how much more liqued it is made, by melting it with oyle of Roſes, ſo much the more mylder and lenetiue it is.</p>
            <p>But it is brought to the forme of a <hi>Cerote,</hi> when vnto li.i. of the medicine, ye adde of oyle li.ſs. and after this ſort it is profitable vnto inflamations declining. And alſo healpeth better the inflamed tumors of the fundament and ſtraight gut that ſpring of themſelues, then any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
            <p>But then muſt it be liquified with ſtore of oyle. That it may be conuayed in, in the forme of a cliſter. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more we often in ſuch caſes liquified the ſame in oyle of Roſes, putting firſt vnder the veſſell wherein it melteth, a kettell with hot watter therein, which muſt ſtand ouer burning cooles, or a cléere flame without ſmoke. And bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo melted after the ſame manner of temperature before mencioned, ſo that it haue forme of a ſoft <hi>Cerote,</hi> it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly healeth not onely the vlcers of the preuy parts, and the fundament, but alſo all others, euen to the vlcerated kibes and burninges.</p>
            <p>For it deliuereth them foorthwith fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inflamations, and maketh them pure, and filleht them with firme fleſh, and eſpcially when there is in the medicine good ſtore of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeos.</hi> But note that wine muſt be alſo mixt with the medicine that ſhall worke the effect. And if you mixe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with vineger, it is good for burning, both at the firſt, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:306:125"/> alſo at any time afterward layd therevnto. Whether it bée then bli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tered or not. And it is of the like effecte to thoſe that are ſkalded with hot water. Moreouer if you laye on this medicine before the inflamation begin, it letteth much, and reſtrayneth not a little the generation thereof. And therefore as I haue ſaide, many that cut <hi>Hernies,</hi> vſe the ſame by and by, not once moleſting the wound before, and beſides all this, to vſe it vpon contuſions, to fractures, and to all ſortes of woundes, if it be laide to them liquid, it is a preſent remedie, ſo it be applied artificially with conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent rowling, or ligature, ſuch as commonly are vſed in rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, moreouer it helpeth all <hi>oedematus</hi> tumors and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations, when the body aboundeth with euill ioyce, or elſe it is of much ſence, laying the ſame as ſoone as may be to the beaten and contuſed partes, and you ſhall put ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of freſh Henbane, which if by reaſan either of the time of the yéere, or of the place it be not to be hadde, then ſhall ye vſe that which hath béene gathered and preſerued in the Summer.</p>
            <p>And alſo the ioyce of <hi>Mandnragora</hi> mixed with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, maketh it the more milder and pleaſant. And of this liquor or ioyce, it ſhall ſuffice to temper or mixe ℥.i. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with a pound of the emplaſter being liquified with oyle, putting in ſometime more, and ſometime leſſe as néede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
            <p>It is alſo requiſite that in ſuch bodies, the medicine ſhould be melted with oyle of Roſes. But vnto ſuch parts as are hurt by a fall, or bruſed with a ſtaffe, clubbe, or ſtone, although there happen a congelation, yet may this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, euen the beginning commodiouſly be applyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, being mixed with wine, as we haue before taught. Which wine muſt bée left out the third day, or at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, the fourth day, if the part bée voyde of inflamation, and then muſt you liquifie the emplaiſter with olde Oyle.
<pb facs="tcp:306:126"/> For if the humor be much con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Moreouer I doe vſe this medicine agaynſt <hi>Heriſipelas,</hi> and chiefely vnto thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be conioyned with inflamations, Laying it on at the firſt, melted with oyle of roſes, which is made <hi>ex Olio Omphaſini,</hi> which is gréene or vnripe oyle, and without ſalt, for ſuch oyle vnto <hi>Heriſipelas</hi> is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, and when it is therewith liquified, the ioyce of nightſhade or <hi>Solatrum,</hi> is moſt diligently to be mixed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, throughly, and well wrought in a Morter.</p>
            <p>If that be not to be had, ye ſhall vſe the ioyce of <hi>Pſylliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Moreouer the ioyſe of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celane of it ſelfe cannot ſo conueniently be vſed, becauſe of the toughneſſe, and thickneſſe of the ſame, and therefore the beſt way is that you take the ioyſe of the ſower grapes, and commixe it with your ioyſe of Purcelane, and ſo bring them into one body or forme, and then to ſtraine it out. And in like ſorte ſhall ye ſtraine out the ioyſe of Singreéene, for alone no man can ſtraine foorth any ſtore of ioyce, nor of Peneworte.</p>
            <p>But the new freſh ioyſe of gréene Mandrage Appls put thereto, maketh this medicine the more conuenient. For the which if the time of the yéere ſerue not, thou ſhalt not doubt to vſe that which is brought from Candy, or ſome other place.

            <p>But when we looſed the thigh the day foolowing, and had determined to cut it, we found all fallen dry, &amp; voide of moiſture.</p>
            <p>Therfore all men may know, that it ſtood with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to vſe the medicine both the next daie, and likewiſe, the daies folowing.</p>
            <p>For ſo much as the part waxed euery day better cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, and euerie where founder then before. After that I had in this caſe cured this young man, I cured with this medicine, many romaticke affects, euen ſuch as had but one orifice, and the ſame inwarly, and in the manner of a Fiſtulae, and that could not be conglutinated. And I doe will al men not to leaue off this vſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> medicine, although for many days it ſéeme to yéeld no euident healp. For that, that it may afterwarde ſometime, euen in ſome one day, at once ſhew ſome vniuerſall and moſt notable commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ye may boldly vſe alwaies this medicine in rhumatick affects, and in tenter bodies, as in Children, or in women, mixed after the manner aforeſaide, namelie putting in of the <hi>Chalciteos ℥iiij.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in a ſtrong and hard body, put in more according to the meaſure of their exceſſe, either ounce i. or two, that their may be of the <hi>Chalciteos,</hi> v. or vi. ounce. And of each of the other two li.iii. to witt of olde oyle, &amp; <hi>Argenti Spuma.</hi> And of olde greaſe li.ii. which the Appoticaries call <hi>Auxun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the diſeaſes that come of rheumes, let it bée melted with ſweete oyle, neither too new, nor too olde.</p>
            <p>And vſe of the wine that is tarte, &amp; of a meane age. This medicine reprooueth the vayne trifling of <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> yelding moſt effectuous helpe, &amp; it is compounded of things that are
<pb facs="tcp:306:128"/> indued with contrary qualities.</p>
            <p>From the which if ye take away one ſorte, none of the effects aforeſaide ſhall follow.</p>
            <p>For by relaxatiue ſimples onely without aſtrictiues, it bringeth to rheumatick affects, little co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modie. Nor yet to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or increaſing inflamations, neither can it haue the vertue, to aſſwage paine, or to diſcuſſe. Relaxatiues without aſtrictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whoſe office is to mollifie things hard, and it will moreouer perfectly ſouple, and moderately mollifie, if the oyle and greaſe that is put therein bée not too olde.</p>
            <p>The medicine therfore that <hi>Mnaſſeus</hi> made hath both oyle, <hi>Spuma Argenti,</hi> and <hi>Adeps,</hi> together of equall quantitie. But it is moſt contrary to beginning and increaſing infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macions, howbeit this our medicine hath all that <hi>Mnaſſeu</hi> medicine hath to witte, <hi>Spuma Argenti, Adpes,</hi> and <hi>Oleum.</hi> But if it haue therein no aſtrictiues, it weakneth the partes, and diſſolueth their ſtrength, by reaſon whereof they are made to the flowing of humours.</p>
            <p>For you may know that the partes, of the body doe not alwaie by reaſon of immoderate heate ſuffer fluxes, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſame chaunceth rarely.</p>
            <p>But that their weakeneſſe doeth bréede ſuch griefes, which for the moſt part procéedeth of a colde intempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Therefore if any man will moyſten and heate thoſe parts with relaxatiue medicines, they ſhalbe vtterly diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thereby and made weake.</p>
            <p>And againe if any man will vehemently conſtraine tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in rheumatick griefes, he ſhall not at the firſt ſéeme to profit, but the remaines he ſhall make rebellious and <hi>Scirrhous,</hi> for ſuch affects admitte not in déed the applcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things that be too aſtringent.</p>
            <p>For that they are by them moleſted with paine &amp; extenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But all paines doth vexe and moleſt the inflamed parts.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:306:128"/> And giueth occaſion of fluxes, allthough the pacient bée not affected with any rheumatick intemperature. But it is no maruaill at all though <hi>Theſſalus</hi> (who is vnexpert in the workes of the arte of medicine, and knoweth not by reaſon how to finde out diſeaſes) be ignorant in the cures of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations. But you, who haue often ſéene in many griefes, moſt manifeſt healpes, as well of <hi>Phenichini,</hi> as alſo of other medicines that conſiſt of contrary vertues, muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour (where you haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pound medicines in remedies,) to confect medicines by the ſame method of ſuch ſimples as the Countrie yéeldeth. Namely to vſe when you ſuſpect the comming of an inflamation. Or when it is already begun, to vſe medicines more aſtringent. But in the ſtate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, ſuch as doe mollifie and digeſt. And yet muſt you alwaies mixe together both the faculties repercuſſiue, and diſcuſſiue.</p>
            <p>Vnleſſe it be when the flux is throughly ſtayed, and that the dody is emptie. For then may you ſafelie haue recourſe to the digeſtiues vertue. Euen as in the beginning, you may apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie repercuſſiues. &amp;c.</p>

And beſides I haue therevnto added the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Emplaiſter Chalciteos. For although I haue red his compoſition and diuers aucthors, yet of none, ſo at large as of Galen him ſelfe.</p>
            <p>For it appeareth he was not onely ſtudious for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting and compounding the ſame, but alſo verie carefull and painefull to alter the ſame into diuers formes and bodies, to ſerue verie neceſſarie vnto diuers griefes &amp; Infirmities.</p>
            <p>But calling to minde that moſt excellent Phiſition, that feared, that in writing a compendious doctrine for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſickeneſſe, he ſhould but looſe his labour, for as much as no man almoſt did endeuour himſelfe to the finding of truth, but that all men did ſo eſteeme ritches, poſſeſſions, aucthoritie, and pleaſures, that they ſuppoſed them which were ſtudious in any part of wiſedome, to be mad or diſtract of their witts. For as much as they deemed the chiefe ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (which is knowledge of thinges belonging as well to God, as to man) to haue no beeing.</p>
            <p>Since this noble writer found that lacke in his time, when there flouriſhed in ſundrie Countries, a great multitude of men, excellent in all kinds of learning, as it doth appeare by ſome of their workes, why ſhould I thinke my ſelfe iniured, if I ſhould taſte of he ſame cuppe, as my predeceſſours, and other good men of my Countrie haue come. Of whome I will repeate a few, who, in my time haue abidden the hotte and fierie aſſaults of Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>As namely M. Thomas Gale. M. Iohn Hall, M. Iohn Banniſter, Maiſter William Clowes, with others which in our time both written. For being on a time in companie, by chaunce it was tolde me vnto my face, that there were too many bookes ſet ſoorth in the Engliſh toung, and that our bookes did more harme then good, and that the Arte
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:306:130"/> therby is made co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon. For that quoth he, euerie Gentleman is as wel able to reaſon therin, as our ſelues. A thing truely to be lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, for if heretofore, Emperours, kings, princes, dukes Earles, Lords, Barrons, Knightes, beſides diuers Gentlemen, hath not onely red and practiſed the ſame, but alſo greatlye augemented the knowledge thereof. And I could well wiſh in theſe dayes it were better looked into, both of Nobles, Gentles, Iuſtices, and alſo of good Captaines, for then the common weale ſhould not onely be furniſhed of good and learned Surgions, but alſo her Maieſtie the better ſerued in the warres, as well by Sea as by Lande.</p>
            <p>And beſides, thoſe that are Surgions, would better follow their bookes and practiſe, if it were but for ſhame, that theſe Gentlemen ſhould not diſcouer their blind practiſe, and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ignorance. And ſo bring this auncient and famous, arte into great credit, which now (by meanes of gredie gripes, and deuouring Caterpillers, who onelie contemne learning) is brought to great infamy, and ſcandall.</p>
            <p>But there be that can ſay what neede we care for bookes, as longe as we can when neede is, call vnto vs vj. viij. or ten of our friendes to aſsiſt vs, who are &amp; ſhalbe our beſt bookes.</p>
            <p>But I demaunde of theſe, what if God ſend a plague, and take away theſe bookes who are mortall. Or if theſe bookes ſhould be preſt into her maieſties ſhippes and ſo be diſſeuered? or what if one of theſe ſhould happen into the countrie, where no ſuch helpes are, where were then their knowledge. Might not a man well thinke their patients to be (as Hippocrates termeth them) the Children of fortune? and that they are cured by chaunce? but not by arte. And therefore it was not without cauſe that Maiſter Iohn Hall in his verſes ſet after the third treatiſe of anatomy, vſeth theſe words,
